# Authentica

This is our Tink-her-Hack project.
ABOUT THE PROJECT
Authentica, the certificate generator web application, is a user-friendly tool that allows users to create professional-looking  certificates. With a simple and intuitive interface such as recipient name, achievements, and other details. This web application helps to generate a high quality certificate that can be downloaded as a pdf document.

STACK USED
To implement this project, we have used HTML,CSS and JavaScript and have imported a PDFKit module. The certificate generator consists of mainly two web pages.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
->The first page is an introductory page which consists of a create button that redirects to the next page.
->The second web page provides the facility to fill in the details of the certificate from the user.
->The final submit button enables the user to generate and download the certificate in pdf format.

The first html file, index.html provides a link to the second html file, pgrm.html. style.css contains the  basic font designs for our web pages. We have developed a template design which is saved as Certificate.pdf. The details which are entered by the user are retrieved by the javascript file, index.js which thereafter prints them at the respective positions of the certificate. The final certificate is available to download.
